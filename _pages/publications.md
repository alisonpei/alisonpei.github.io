### [Monopsony in the High-Skilled Migrant Labor Market-Evidence from H-1B Petition Data](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4010152)

**Abstract:** This paper assesses the extent of monopsony in the H-1B labor market through the lens of employment concentration and its effect on H-1B workers' wages. Using FOIA-requested micro-level H-1B petition data, we calculate the H-1B employment concentration using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) from 2010 to 2021. We first discover that the H-1B labor market is nearly twice as concentrated as the broader U.S. labor market, with a steady increasing trend over the last two decades. We then examine the impact of high employment concentration on H-1B workers' wages. The causal link is established by exploiting a lottery system implemented for over-the-cap H-1B applications that generate random labor supplies for each labor market. We find that larger firms disproportionately get more new workers from the exogenous increase in the market-level lottery win rate. These unbalanced distributions of new H-1B workers increase HHI, which in turn, reduces the H-1B workers' wages in the corresponding labor market. A shift from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the employment concentration distribution decreases the workers' wage by 7.1 percent. These local average treatment effects are the largest for first-time Chinese applicants in scientific and technical services.

### The Enforceability of Noncompete Agreements and Innovation: Evidence from State Law Changes
with [Matthew Johnson](https://sites.google.com/site/mslaterjohnson/) and [Michael Lipsitz](https://sites.google.com/site/malipsitz/) (draft forthcoming)\
Presented at _Wharton People and Organizations Conference 2022_; _APPAM 2022_ \
**Abstract:** Noncompete agreements (NCAs), which prevent employees from working for competitors post-employment, may help firms prevent leakage of sensitive intellectual property. While private benefits may accrue to firms using NCAs, such protection may have negative spillover effects by reducing recombination of ideas and thinkers across firms, leading to less overall innovation in the economy. We assess the extent to which NCAs impact innovation in the economy by exploring the relationship between NCA enforceability and several measures of innovation. We show that stricter NCA enforceability negatively and substantially impacts innovation, reducing patent counts and patent quality. While increased use of patents in response to stricter enforceability may simply be due to a substitution of intellectual property protections (from patents to NCAs), this does not appear to be the case: two counts of high quality patents experience larger negative impacts from NCA enforceability compared with the impact on low-quality patents, and patenting in fields in which patenting is ubiquitous (and where substitution would therefore not occur) is negatively affected by NCA enforceability, as well. Next, we assess whether NCA enforceability causes innovative activity to reallocate across establishments within firms, and find evidence that such a reallocation mechanism cannot explain the overall negative impact we identify. We close by identifying additional avenues for future research that we hope to explore as we develop this article.
