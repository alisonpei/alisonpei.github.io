**Abstract:** This paper assesses the extent of monopsony in the H-1B labor market through the lens of employment concentration and its effect on H-1B workers' wages. Using FOIA-requested micro-level H-1B petition data, we calculate the H-1B employment concentration using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) from 2010 to 2021. We first discover that the H-1B labor market is nearly twice as concentrated as the broader U.S. labor market, with a steady increasing trend over the last two decades. We then examine the impact of high employment concentration on H-1B workers' wages. The causal link is established by exploiting a lottery system implemented for over-the-cap H-1B applications that generate random labor supplies for each labor market. We find that larger firms disproportionately get more new workers from the exogenous increase in the market-level lottery win rate. These unbalanced distributions of new H-1B workers increase HHI, which in turn, reduces the H-1B workers' wages in the corresponding labor market. A shift from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the employment concentration distribution decreases the workers' wage by 7.1 percent. These local average treatment effects are the largest for first-time Chinese applicants in scientific and technical services.\

**Abstract:** Worker mobility across firms can enhance innovation by spreading knowledge, but such mobility may also hinder innovation by making firms reluctant to invest in R&D. A common way that firms limit workers' mobility is with noncompete agreements (NCAs). We examine how the legal enforceability of NCAs affects innovation, as measured by patenting, using data on every state-level NCA enforceability change between 1991–2014. We find that making NCAs easier to enforce (“stricter” enforceability) substantially reduces the rate of patenting: an average-sized increase in NCA enforceability leads a state to have 16-19% fewer citation-weighted patents over the following 10 years. This effect reflects a true loss in innovation rather than a reduction in useless or strategic patents. We then reconcile these findings with contrasting theoretical predictions. Stricter NCA enforceability reduces job mobility and new business formation in innovative industries, suggesting slower knowledge spread. Within publicly-traded firms, stricter NCA enforceability increases investment, but still leads to less innovation, suggesting that any gains from enhanced incentives to invest are more than offset by other ways that NCAs slow down innovation. Finally, using variation in technology classes’ exposure to NCA enforceability changes, we show that the economy-wide losses to innovation from strict enforceability are even larger than what our state-level estimates imply.\
