Alison Pei is a 4th-year PhD Candidate at Duke University. Her interest is at the intersection of Labor Economics and Industrial Organization. 
Her research falls into three categories: 

1) monopsony power in the high-skilled foreign labor market; 
2) the role of non-compete enforceability in shaping the directions and outcomes of innovation; 
3) policies that improve the allocation efficiency of high-skilled workers across firms.
