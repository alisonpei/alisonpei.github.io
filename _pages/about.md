Hello! I am a 4th-year PhD Candidate at Duke University. My interest is at the intersection of Labor Economics and Industrial Organization. 

My current research projects fall into three categories: /
* Monopsony power in the high-skilled foreign labor market; /
* The role of non-compete enforceability in shaping the directions and outcomes of innovation; /
* Policies that improve the allocation efficiency of high-skilled workers across firms.
